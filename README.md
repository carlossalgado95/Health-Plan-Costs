### **GOAL** 

You have been hired as a data scientist for the health plan operator wsh. Your first job as a data scientist is to develop a methodology for predicting the value of the health plan for your beneficiaries.

### **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

The project was divided into 4 parts:


1 - Understanding the business problem
- Develop a methodology for predicting the value of the health plan for your beneficiaries

2 - exploratory analysis
  - Exploratory analysis through the database, in order to plot graphs for better visualization, explore a little more about age, muscle mass, children, gender, smoker and region.
  
3- Preprocessing
 - Age rounding on the training base, feature selection, split independent variables.
 
4 Construction and evaluation of forecasting models
- Creation of machine learning models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest and Test results

- ### **CONCLUSION**
After testing,it was VERIFIED that the regression models obtained results very close to each other, varying within 0.1 the value of r2 score, with the random forest model being the best model tested, with an r2 score of 0.90

- ### **NEXT STEPS**

For the next steps, it is important to tune the hyper parameters, for better precision and results.
